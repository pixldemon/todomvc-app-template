## Implementation

This is still WIP. This implementation does not yet fully adhere to the [TodoMVC spec](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md). At the moment, it mainly exists to provide a general idea of what Cyanic is still missing in terms of features, optimizations and API.
